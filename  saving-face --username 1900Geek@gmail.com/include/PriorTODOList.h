/*
*Priority number if assigned, followed by the TODO

* Class sf_sdk_session
* (Highest) Method to convert Nose Landmark to a depth vertice
******Note Use Projection->MapColorToDepthCoords.
* (Medium) Save video
* (Medium) Save Snapshot


*
* Class Model_Builder
* Implement functions that recieve YPR and Nose/calculate and save the Tr_Matrix to a local pointer.
* Make a process vertice method... and build the model. (Major milestone).
* Un-implemented methods... High priority (Most depend on sf_sdk functionality)
* Save Video Option... (to be implemented in sf_session first)
* Save Snapshot... (to be implemented in sf_session first)... Save the image of the last frame used to build.
* 
* TESTS TODO
*
* Class Model
* Add params to keep track of comparison tracking. (Figure out the params later)
* Add return fail status and do not save, if initModelArr has not been called.
* 

*Classes that are Finished and Tested
*sf_tr_func (Well Should add more testing for modelspace coords... But should become self-evident if there is a problem).
*sf_db (I feel confident this is done -Andy)
*sf_util (this class is tested in testDatabaseFileIOStreams and works)
